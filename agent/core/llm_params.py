    """Neuter LiteLLM 1.83's hardcoded effort-level validation.

    Context: at ``litellm/llms/anthropic/chat/transformation.py:~1443`` the
    Anthropic adapter validates ``output_config.effort ∈ {high, medium,
    low, max}`` and gates ``max`` behind an ``_is_opus_4_6_model`` check
    that only matches the substring ``opus-4-6`` / ``opus_4_6``. Result:

    * ``xhigh`` — valid on Anthropic's real API for Claude 4.7 — is
      rejected pre-flight with "Invalid effort value: xhigh".
    * ``max`` on Opus 4.7 is rejected with "effort='max' is only supported
      by Claude Opus 4.6", even though Opus 4.7 accepts it in practice.

    We don't want to maintain a parallel model table, so we let the
    Anthropic API itself be the validator: widen ``_is_opus_4_6_model``
    to also match ``opus-4-7``+ families, and drop the valid-effort-set
    check entirely. If Anthropic rejects an effort level, we see a 400
    and the cascade walks down — exactly the behavior we want for any
    future model family.

    Removable once litellm ships 1.83.8-stable (which merges PR #25867,
    "Litellm day 0 opus 4.7 support") — see commit 0868a82 on their main
    branch. Until then, this one-time patch is the escape hatch.

    Build LiteLLM kwargs for a given model id.

    • ``anthropic/<model>`` — native thinking config. We bypass LiteLLM's
      ``reasoning_effort`` → ``thinking`` mapping (which lags new Claude
      releases like 4.7 and sends the wrong API shape). Instead we pass
      both ``thinking={"type": "adaptive"}`` and ``output_config=
      {"effort": <level>}`` as top-level kwargs — LiteLLM's Anthropic
      adapter forwards unknown top-level kwargs into the request body
      verbatim (confirmed by live probe; ``extra_body`` does NOT work
      here because Anthropic's API rejects it as "Extra inputs are not
      permitted"). This is the stable API for 4.6 and 4.7. Older
      extended-thinking models that only accept ``thinking.type.enabled``
      will reject this; the probe's cascade catches that and falls back
      to no thinking.

    • ``openai/<model>`` — ``reasoning_effort`` forwarded as a top-level
      kwarg (GPT-5 / o-series). LiteLLM uses the user's ``OPENAI_API_KEY``.

    • ``google/<model>`` — Google AI Studio's Gemini API via LiteLLM.
      LiteLLM picks up ``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` or ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` from the
      environment and maps ``reasoning_effort`` to Gemini thinking config
      for models that support it.

    • ``google-geap/<model>`` — Google Vertex AI through LiteLLM. LiteLLM
      uses Google application-default credentials plus ``VERTEXAI_PROJECT``
      and ``VERTEXAI_LOCATION``/``GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION``. For Gemini models,
      ``reasoning_effort`` is forwarded as a top-level kwarg and mapped to
      Gemini thinking config.

    • Anything else is treated as a HuggingFace router id. We hit the
      auto-routing OpenAI-compatible endpoint at
      ``https://router.huggingface.co/v1``. The id can be bare or carry an
      HF routing suffix (``:fastest`` / ``:cheapest`` / ``:<provider>``).
      A leading ``huggingface/`` is stripped. ``reasoning_effort`` is
      forwarded via ``extra_body`` (LiteLLM's OpenAI adapter refuses it as
      a top-level kwarg for non-OpenAI models). "minimal" normalizes to
      "low".

    ``strict=True`` raises ``UnsupportedEffortError`` when the requested
    effort isn't in the provider's accepted set, instead of silently
    dropping it. The probe cascade uses strict mode so it can walk down
    (``max`` → ``xhigh`` → ``high`` …) without making an API call. Regular
    runtime callers leave ``strict=False``, so a stale cached effort
    can't crash a turn — it just doesn't get sent.

    Token precedence (first non-empty wins):
      1. INFERENCE_TOKEN env — shared key on the hosted Space (inference is
         free for users, billed to the Space owner via ``X-HF-Bill-To``).
      2. session.hf_token — the user's own token (CLI / OAuth / cache file).
      3. HF_TOKEN env — belt-and-suspenders fallback for CLI users.
